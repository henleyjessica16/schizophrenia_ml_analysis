# üß† Schizophrenia Risk Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the files for a comprehensive Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA) project focused on **predicting the risk of schizophrenia** using machine learning. The primary goal was to explore proactive detection techniques that could supplement conventional diagnosis and enhance early intervention strategies for this debilitating condition.

The project involved extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and validation, culminating in a final report and presentation of key findings.
